A meal cost calculator

Now you are going to work on your own for one final challenge to sharpen up your JavaScript skills before we dive more deeply into Node.js. You are going to write a short application which will total up the cost of a meal, work out the tax and tip which should be paid, and split the bill fairly between the diners.

Don't worry about making a UI for this project. You won't ask for user input; instead, create sample seed data inside the application to run your calculations. All output should be sent as plain text to the console.

Project specification
For your finished project you need to be able to:

Create diner objects which represent a single diner.
Add dishes to a diner's meal
Total up the cost of all of the diners' meals
Add a fixed tax percentage to the total bill
Add a percentage tip to the total bill
Split the bill fairly among the diners
Each diner should pay the tax on their own food
Each diner should pay an equal share of the tip
If you choose to round the amounts, you may notice that the sum of the amounts does not equal the total bill amount anymore. Don't worry about that, or distribute the discrepancy in a fair way for an extra challenge.
Print out a total bill
Print a breakdown for what each diner owes
